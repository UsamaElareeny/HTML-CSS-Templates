# HTML-CSS-Templates
Welcome to the HTML & CSS Templates repository! This collection is designed to help developers and designers jumpstart their web projects with beautifully crafted and responsive HTML and CSS templates. I used these templates personally to master CSS & HTML. I believe whether you're working on a personal website, a professional portfolio, an e-commerce site, or a corporate web page, you'll find a variety of templates to suit your needs too.
